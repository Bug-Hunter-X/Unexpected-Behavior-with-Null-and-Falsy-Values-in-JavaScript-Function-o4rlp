# JavaScript Function Bug: Handling Null and Falsy Values

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in a JavaScript function related to the handling of null and falsy values. The original function only checks for strict null equality, which might lead to unexpected outcomes when undefined or other falsy values are passed as arguments.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function intends to add two numbers. However, it only explicitly checks for null using the strict equality operator (`===`). This oversight causes issues when undefined or other falsy values (e.g., 0, "", false) are provided as input. The function should either handle these cases gracefully or provide explicit error handling for invalid input types.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves enhancing the function to check for both null and undefined values, or alternatively, to implement a more robust input validation mechanism.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `bug.js` file (e.g., using Node.js): `node bug.js`.
4. Observe the output and compare it with the expected output based on the comments in the code.
5. Then run the `bugSolution.js` to see the fixed code and its output.
